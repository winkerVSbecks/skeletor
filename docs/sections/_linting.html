  <p>The ultimate goal is to have a codebase which looks like the same person wrote it. The reasoning behind this is to promote readable and consistent coding styles. It makes code easier to read, allows all developers to understand the intent behind it, and makes refactoring easier.</p>

  <p><a href="https://github.com/causes/scss-lint">scss-lint</a> helps automate this process and outputs any problems with your SCSS, including the offending filename and line number (if available).</p>

  <p>The rules of linting are defined in <code>scss-lint.yml</code> file. Should you want to customize the checks run against your code, you can do so by editing this file. You can see the list of all available options in the <a href="https://github.com/causes/scss-lint/blob/master/config/default.yml">default configuration file</a>. Refer to to the <a href="https://github.com/causes/scss-lint/blob/master/lib/scss_lint/linter/README.md">linters documentation</a> for more information.</p>
