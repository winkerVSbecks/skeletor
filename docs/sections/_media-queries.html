  <p>Skeletor uses media queries to serve its scalable grid, but also has a list of queries for convenience of styling your site across devices. The queries are mobile-first, meaning they target <code>min-width</code>. Mobile-first queries are how Skeletor's grid is built and is the preferrable method of organizing CSS. It means all styles outside of a query apply to all devices, then larger devices are targeted for enhancement. This prevents small devices from having to parse tons of unused CSS. The sizes for the queries are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Desktop HD: <code>1200px</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      Desktop: <code>1000px</code>
    </li>

      Tablet: <code>750px</code>
